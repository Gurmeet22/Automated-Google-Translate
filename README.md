# Google-Translate
A Web-Scraping project to automate translations. A translations.csv file is taken as input where first column contains text to be translated and second column contains langage to which the corressponding text is to be translated. Output is a translatedData.csv file which contains first two columns as described earlier and a third column which will contain translated text.
